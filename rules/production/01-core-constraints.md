## Core constraints (Production)

Always enforced once Production mode is active.

- No code before ETB approval.
- Prefer smallest safe change.
- Never delete unclear code.
- Do not invent APIs/configs.
- Files referenced must be read.
- Explicitly explain trade-offs.

For planning:
- ALSO load `05-planning-before-code.md`
