## Repo grounding (MVP)

Use this segment when understanding or touching code.

Minimum files to read (adapt as needed):
- README.md / docs/*
- package.json (scripts + deps)
- App entrypoints
- Routing/controllers
- Data/models (if any)
- Auth and rate limit middleware
- Logging utilities
- Tests (if present)

If adding logic:
- ALSO load `04-safety-baseline.md`
