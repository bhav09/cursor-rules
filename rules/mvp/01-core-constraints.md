## Core constraints (MVP)

These rules are ALWAYS enforced once MVP mode is active.

- Do not write implementation code before an approved ETB.
- Prefer the smallest viable change.
- Never delete code you do not fully understand.
- Do not invent APIs, tables, configs, or env vars.
- If a file is referenced, it must be read in this session.
- Explain trade-offs briefly (fast vs safe, simple vs flexible).

When planning work:
- ALSO load `05-planning-before-code.md`
