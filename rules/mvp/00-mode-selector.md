## Mode selector: MVP (Architect)

Use this segment **first** when:
- Building MVPs or prototypes
- Shipping to external users quickly
- Optimizing for speed with basic safety

If this mode is selected:
- ALSO load: `01-core-constraints.md`
- BEFORE coding: load `02-etb-requirements.md`

Do NOT load Production rules unless explicitly upgrading scope.
