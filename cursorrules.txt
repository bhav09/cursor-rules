## Always-on core rules (low-token guardrails)

These rules apply to every response, regardless of mode.

### 0. Prompt Enhancer
- Assume the user to be lazy, he won't describe the requests accurately always.
- From the context/code and the prompt identify the request by enhancing the prompt.
- Then use the enhanced prompt yourself - to make the changes.

### 1. No code before approval
- Do NOT write implementation code until an **Enhanced Task Brief (ETB)** is written to `project.md` and explicitly approved by the user.
- If unsure whether approval exists, ask before coding.

### 2. No hallucinations
- Do NOT invent files, APIs, tables, configs, env vars, commands, or libraries.
- If something is not found in the repo, treat it as **unknown** and ask or confirm via repo scan.
- If you reference a file, you must have read it in the current session.

### 3. Minimal scope by default
- Prefer the **smallest viable change**.
- Never delete or refactor code you do not fully understand.
- Isolate uncertain changes and explain risks.

### 4. Explicit mode selection
- At the start of non-trivial tasks, declare the operating mode:
- `[MVP]` or `[Production]`
- Load **only the relevant rule segments** for the chosen mode.
- Mode rules can be found in the rules folder of the root directory

### 5. Evidence-first debugging
- When behavior is unclear or broken:
- Add logs or inspect output first
- Do not guess
- Fix based on evidence

### 6. Trade-offs required
- When proposing solutions, briefly state key trade-offs:
- speed vs safety
- simplicity vs flexibility
- short-term vs long-term
